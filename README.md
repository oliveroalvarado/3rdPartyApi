# 3rd Party API's

In this assignment you will practice utilizing different API's that require authentication keys, hiding keys in `.env` files and integrating it to your own API.

## Assignment

- Start a new project with an app where all api calls will be made from.
- Choose 2 apis from the [Github Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) that require authentication keys or OAuth keys and integrate them to your own api enpoints that you can ping through requests on your Django Project
- Choose 2 free apis from [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/hub) and fully integrate them to your own api endpoints that you can ping through requests on your Django Project

By the end of this assingment, your project should have 4 separate endpoints each connected to it's own api.
